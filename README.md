## what you can expect to see when going through my repositories
my public github consists of projects ive built to scratch that itch of curiosity. if there are any projects ive made youve seen elsewhere (linkedin, website [coming soon!]) and you want to learn more, shoot me a message anywhere!

note: each of my learning projects contain my motivations and goals for the project in the README.md, so take a look if you want to know the ‚Äúwhy‚Äùs
